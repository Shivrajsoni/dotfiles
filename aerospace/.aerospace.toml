# AeroSpace config — i3-like tiling on macOS
# Docs: https://nikitabobko.github.io/AeroSpace/guide
#
# This config is based on best practices from the AeroSpace community.
# It includes a dedicated resize mode and other improvements.
#
# NOTE: Some features like [theme] and [workspace-names] are not supported
# in your current AeroSpace version (0.19.2-Beta).
# Consider updating AeroSpace to get the latest features.
